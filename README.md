# Thesis_Sampling_weights_in_Autoencoders

This repository contains the coder for all the experiments coducted for my Master's Thesis "Sampling weights in Autoencoders"

Structure
------------
**swimnetworks/** implements the SWIM algorithm for sampling weights of neural networks, found in the paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16830

**Autoencoder_Experiments_and_Results/Modules** contains all the modules and helper functions needed

**Autoencoder_Experiments_and_Results/Autoencoder_Experiments.py** contains the code for all the experiments run to test the autoenocder with different datasets and hyperparameters

**Autoencoder_Experiments_and_Results/Autoencoder_comparison_to_other_approaches.py** contains the experiments for comparing the approach to other approaches

**Autoencoder_Experiments_and_Results/maniolds.ipynb** is a notebook to view results of classical manifold learning algorithms on manifolds from sklearn and testing our autoencoder on those manifolds
